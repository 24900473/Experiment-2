# Experiment-2
Write a program in Python language for Matrix multiplication fails. Introspect the causes for its failure and write down the possible reasons for its failure. 
## Aim
The aim of this program is to perform matrix multiplication, understand the causes for failure during its execution, and identify possible reasons for failure. Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices. The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix for multiplication to be possible.

## Algorithm
1.	Input the dimensions of the matrices: First, input the number of rows and columns for both matrices.
2.	Check for multiplication compatibility: Ensure the number of columns of the first matrix is equal to the number of rows of the second matrix.
3.	Input matrix elements: Input the elements for both matrices.
4.	Perform matrix multiplication: For each element in the resultant matrix, sum the products of the corresponding row and column elements from the two matrices.
5.	Output the resulting matrix: Display the resultant matrix.
